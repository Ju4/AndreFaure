Page 112 (Small hands) is an ongoing anthology of notes, folded pages, and traces left by former owners, inside EECummings Complete Poems books.

The collection began after a series of fortuitous encounters.  
Looking for a poem on page 112.  
At the 24th book received, still not there.  
Some words on the flyleaf. « To Angela ..(..).. »  
However, a sheet of paper folded on page 366, with the wanted poem handwritten, and a sequence of words arranged inside.
